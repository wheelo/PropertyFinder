# PropertyFinder
This is one updated version of 'PropertyFinder' app which works in lastest React-Native. 

# Description
Following the website [tutorial I published on Ray Wenderlich's website](http://www.raywenderlich.com/99473/introducing-react-native-building-apps-javascript). I clean some unnecessary code and update the origin version of [ReactNative-PropertyFinder](https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/ReactNative-PropertyFinder).

How to use it is quite straightforward:
```sh
>> react-native init PropertyFinder
>> npm install
```
