# PropertyFinder
This is one updated version of 'PropertyFinder' app which works in lastest React-Native. 

## Description
Following the website published on [Ray Wenderlich](http://www.raywenderlich.com/99473/introducing-react-native-building-apps-javascript) and [深入浅出 React Native](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/19996445). I clean code and update the original 'PropertyFinder' app, which is originally implemented in [ReactNative-PropertyFinder](https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/ReactNative-PropertyFinder).

It is quite straightforward to use it:
```sh
>> react-native init PropertyFinder
>> npm install
```

## Todo
- refactor navigation using [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation) to make app work in both android and iOS
