# PropertyFinder
This is one updated version of 'PropertyFinder' app which works in lastest React-Native. 

## Description
Following the website published on [Ray Wenderlich](http://www.raywenderlich.com/99473/introducing-react-native-building-apps-javascript) and [zhihu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/19996445). I clean code and update the original of 'PropertyFinder' app, which is originally implemented in [ReactNative-PropertyFinder](https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/ReactNative-PropertyFinder).

It is quite straightforward to use it:
